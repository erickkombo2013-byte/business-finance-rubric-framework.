# Business Finance Analysis Rubric Framework

This repository contains a rubric for evaluating outputs from a business finance analysis model, with a focus on scenarios such as restaurant sales analysis. It includes an Excel dataset and sample documents.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: To score model outputs on dimensions like Data Understanding, Statistical Rigor, Insight Quality, etc., with weights and examples.
- **Key Question Example**: "Why did the restaurant's online sales decline year-over-year?" (assuming Gift Card payments proxy coupons).

## Files Included
- **Sample 2.docx**: The main rubric framework, with scoring templates, criteria, rationales, examples for each dimension, and calibration samples (e.g., 5-point, 3-point, 0-point responses).
- **Output.docx**: A sample chain-of-thought analysis output, including steps for data parsing, aggregations, YoY calculations, and a partial hypothesis test.
- **sales (1).xlsx**: The Excel dataset (sheet: "9. Sales-Data-Analysis (2)") with sales records (columns: Order ID, Date, Product, Price, Quantity, Purchase Type, Payment Method, Manager, City). Used for the analysis example.

## How to Use
1. Review the rubric in Sample 2.docx.
2. Apply it to an analysis output (like Output.docx) by scoring each dimension.
3. Use the dataset in sales (1).xlsx for testing or extending the analysis (e.g., via Python/pandas for deeper stats).
